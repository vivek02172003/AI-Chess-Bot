## Introduction
The purpose of this project was to develop an AI chess bot that can play chess against human opponents! Ive played chess every since I was young and I always wondered how chess bots worked. The project started with understanding the basics of chess and simple AI techniques, gradually advancing to more complex algorithms like Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning. The project is implemented using python, taking advantages of libraries such as Pygame and Python-Chess.

## Features
  - Easy-to-use interface for chess games.
  - AI opponent using Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
