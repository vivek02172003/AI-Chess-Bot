The purpose of this project is to develop an AI chess bot that can play chess against human opponents. The project will start with understanding the basics of chess and simple AI techniques, gradually advancing to more complex algorithms and optimizations. This chess bot will be implemented using Python, leveraging basic AI algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning. By the end of this project, a solid understanding of chess rules, Python programming, and fundamental AI concepts will be attained.
